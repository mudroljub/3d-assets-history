Mark V Female easy print by WindhamGraves on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5352155

Easy to print Mark V 1/100 scale, may want some greebling if scaled up. 

Scale by 1.56 for gaslands / hotwheels / 1/64

Scale by 1.786 for 28mm / 1/56 || Apparently 1/52 (x1.923) looks best for heroic 28mm.
